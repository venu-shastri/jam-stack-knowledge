### How Netlify CMS Works

---

> Netlify CMS is configured with a YAML file named **config.yml.** This file configures the
> different resources managed by the CMS. These resources are divided up into **collections**.
> Each collection will have its own **section** in the CMS user interface, and each collection
> defines a set of **fields**. These **fields** determine **which UI control**s will appear when editing
> content in each collection.



```yaml
collections:
 - name: "blog"
 - folder: "src/pages/blog"
 - fields:
	- label: "Title"
	  name: "title"
      widget: "string"
    - label: "Publish Date"
      name: "date"
      widget: "datetime"
    - label: "Body"
      name: "body"
      widget: "markdown"
```
